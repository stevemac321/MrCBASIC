The best BASIC compiler found so far is the one from QB64.org.

So far, if I place SCREEN 11 on the first line, the program runs until the map of africa is drawn with the region marks (N, S, etc.) and the prompt" CHOOSE YOUR AREA NOW.  The program does not accept any input at that point.

Also, (this is the original unedited), I needed to add some high line numbers at the end of the program so that it would compile.  I suspect that there are supporting files that supply those line numbers.  We only have this one file because we wanted to see if we could transfer the .BAS to .TXT on the old Mac.  After saving the .BAS to .TXT (as text in the SAVE AS dialog), we took the computer to RE-PC in Tukwila, WA where they bounced the files to a newer MAC then saved to a thumb drive.

The next step is to get on the old computer and suspect the floppy that this AFRICA program was copied from and see if there are additional files.  If there are, then we need to decide whether to just copy a few of them, or a bunch, or the whole thing.

Once we have the complete program, we can try again. If we get stuck, we might ask the QB64 forum for help, and then perhaps explore open sourcing the entire project, and/or hiring someone to do at least the first conversion, perhaps more, or see if the community is interested in jumping in to make these programs available to the public.

Stay tuned...

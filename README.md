The best BASIC compiler found so far is the one from QB64.org.

So far, if I place SCREEN 11 on the first line, the program runs until the map of africa is drawn with the region marks (N, S, etc.) and the prompt" CHOOSE YOUR AREA NOW.  The program does not accept any input at that point.

Mouse input needs to be refactored, mouse handling is more complex now.  I added a subroutine that gets the CHX, CHY, and B params. 

Replaced delay loops with sleep calls.  Need to press a key to continue. 

Code references labels not in this source file, e.g. 5000 to 20000, perhaps meant to end program 

WAVE keyword does not seem to be supported, see line 114 (label 349)

Mr. C (orginal author) says that much of the graphics was generated by the MacPaint program.
